# Tsuji F. Wolf's Screeps Code

#### Hello!
Welcome to my 'Screeps' game scripts! Please feel free to use and modify them as you see fit. After all, that is the nature of the game!

#### Legacy Files
These are very depreciated and very hacked-together bits of code. They present an entirely unworkable system of running a complex civilization, and I am only keeping them here as a fallback for myself in case something goes catastrophically wrong in the 'latest' release. I do not reccommend using these, as they are not operable out-of-the-box, and require intense modification to the game memory.

#### Latest (v0.0.1)
This directory contains the current state of my Screeps civilization code. I intend to make this code 100% operable out of the box, so anyone can download it and start running what I hope to be a very stable and intelligent civilization system, with a number of very rich features that will make progress in Screeps easy and fairly automated.

#### Disclaimer
I do strongly believe that a lot of the fun in Screeps is checking up on your little colony and being an active particpant in its development, so I do not intend to write code that will be 100% intelligent. The placing of most structures, the logistics of securing your spawns and room controllers, and the decisions on the best rooms to choose to colonize are choices the player will have to make if they choose to use my code.

This is also not an attempt to write the strongest AI - I am taking a very pacifist, friendly-until-conflict approach to this game. There will be many functions available to establish alliances and trade with other players. Additionally, it will operate on the assumption of a strong passive defense setup - because my focus is on friendly expansion and resource collection, there will not be a ton of next-level combat programming. So if you intend to use this code, I highly reccommend a strong passive defense - lots of walls and ramparts, and plenty of tower power once your RCL is high enough.
